                  and multi-tasking skills. I also worked as an <span class="highlight">Office Assistant</span> around

                In the summer of 2013, the summer before my senior year of high school, I studied abroad in
                <span class="highlight">Ciudad Real, Spain</span>. I actively particiapted in classes about
                <span class="highlight">grammar, culture, and literature</span>. I co-wrote, co-produced, and starred
                in a play written about my and my classmates' experiences living in Spain. However, I learned the
                most about the Spanish language and culture by assimilating into my <span class="highlight">host family</span>'s
                life. My 4-year-old sister and 7-year-old-brother taught me more grammar and cultural lessons than any teacher
                could even begin to touch on. I continue to speak with my host family very often and utilize my
                <span class="highlight">Spanish-speaking ability</span> as often as possible. I have visited my host family
                since and plan to visit again soon. I would love to add a feature to this website that allows for the pages
                to be translated to Spanish.

                In the summer of 2017, I interned with a start-up beauty company called <span class="highlight">Zue Beauty</span>.
                As a <span class="highlight">Marketing Intern</span>, I translated and created content for
                <span class="highlight">Instagram, Facebook, and emails</span> to find customers in the market. I aided the company
                in selling a 5-product sku in <span class="highlight">Whole Foods</span> stores across the country by
                demonstrating the benefits and organic ingredients in each beauty product. While interning at Zue,
                my interest in combining <span class="highlight">Marketing with Information Technology</span> to create
                websites to attract customers spiked as I watched developers behind-the-scenes. Utimately, this internship
                lead me to pursue my Master in Information Systems and become a developer.

                I moved to <span class="highlight">Austin, Texas</span> to begin my career at <span class="highlight">General

                <span class="highlight">Global Brand Sites</span> team and have further worked on the <span class="highlight">Owner
                Center</span> team. Through these two teams, I have advanced my skills in <span class="highlight">CSS, HTML,
                JavaScript, Java, Git, and Adobe Experience Manager</span> through various bug fixes and user stories.
                Through the Brand Sites team, I discovered the importance of good coding practices such as
                <span class="highlight">Mobile-First Design; code optimization, organization, and consistency; and smoke and unit
                testing</span>. While working with the Owner Center team, I explored the significance of <span class="highlight">accessbility
                </span> for all users and the use of the <span class="highlight">Angular JS Framework and BootStrap</span>.
                I strive to learn something new everyday through continuous educational courses, research, and advice
                from senior developers.
